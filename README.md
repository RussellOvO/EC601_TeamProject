# EC601_Team12: High Resolution Images Helper

Our project is mainly based on "HAN: Single Image Super-Resolution via a Holistic Attention Network" (https://github.com/wwlCape/HAN). We added Layer Attention Module(LAM) and Channel-Spatial Attention Module(CSAM) to better our current network.

If you have any suggestions, please contact us by sending email to aowei8@bu.edu or sydong@bu.edu. We are grateful for your advice.
